                        Hi, we’re <a href="https://DOLA.com/">DOLA</a> and welcome!
                        We’re happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy your stay.
                        When we say ‘<strong>we</strong>’,
                        ‘<strong>us</strong>’ or
                        ‘<strong>DOLA</strong>’ it’s because that’s
                        who we are and we own and run the <strong>DOLA Market</strong> sites.
                    </p>

                    <p class="t-body">2.
                        DOLA’s ecosystem of digital marketplaces helps millions of people
                        around the world get creative and earn online. When you create an account
                        and accept these terms you become a <strong>member</strong> of our
                        community. You will have an <strong>DOLA Market account</strong> that
                        will allow you to buy and sell <strong>items</strong> like the ones found
                        on the DOLA Market sites and make other related transactions.
                    </p>

                    <p class="t-body">3.
                        The DOLA Market sites are platforms that allow members to buy and sell
                        licenses to use digital items like website themes, production music,
                        motion graphics project files, software code, vectors, images and much,
                        much more. On DOLA Market, buyers and authors (sellers) transact with
                        each other directly and we provide the platform to allow the transactions
                        to happen. If you have an DOLA Market account, any transactions are logged on your member’s
                        statement,
                        which records the payments made by you to authors via DOLA Market (as a
                        <strong>buyer</strong>) and by buyers via DOLA Market to you (as an
                        <strong>author</strong>).

                        The items on DOLA Market are owned by the authors, not by us.
                        The items on DOLA Market are uploaded at the direction of the author.
                        We provide the platform services; we do not take ownership of the items.</p>

                        these terms so please read and understand them. If you don’t accept
                        the terms then we’ll be sad, but you will need to leave because

                            you acquire the right to use that item; you're not actually acquiring the item itself. What
                            you get includes a
                            license directly from the author to use that item. Items are subject to
                            specific terms of use, and these terms are the ‘license’ that
                            we set on DOLA Market. This license also applies to you if you download
                            an item that someone else has bought for you (because anyone downloading
                            an item needs to be an DOLA Market member). Different license types are
                            available for you to choose when you have selected an item. You’ll
                            need to think about the way you want to use the item so that you can pick
                            the right license to allow that use. It’s your responsibility to
                            choose the correct license.
