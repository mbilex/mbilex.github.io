                                which also applies to our Affiliate Companies. This policy sets out how we handle your
                                personal information if you’re an DOLA user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across

                            <li>When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘DOLA’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the

                            <li>If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re

                        <ol start="6">
                            <li>We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you
                                navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated
                                with the Sites.</li>

                            <li>As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a legitimate interest in
                                verifying the identity of our authors. We believe that knowing who our authors are will
                                strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces by reducing fraud, making authors more
                                accountable for their content and giving DOLA and customers the ability to enforce
                                contracts for authors who break the rules. DOLA also has certain legal obligations
                                that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances. In light of this,
                                if you are an author we will verify your identity, in particular, your name, full
                                address and date of birth by asking you to show us a Photo ID document. The verification
                                procedure is called DOLA Verify. DOLA Verify will be carried out by our service
